## 🎯 Requirements Met

### ✅ Core Requirements
- **TypeScript Project**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- **Cursor Interpretation**: Clearly documented as a Cursor-based interpretation with enhancements
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive Jest test suite with 17 passing tests
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Complete pipeline for TypeScript validation and testing

### ✅ Enhanced Features Added
- **Modern Development Tooling**: ESLint, Jest, comprehensive TypeScript configuration
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the codebase
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with setup instructions and API documentation
- **Developer Experience**: Scripts for development, testing, linting, and deployment

## 📊 Project Status

### Build & Test Results
```
✅ TypeScript Compilation: PASSED
✅ Unit Tests: 17/17 PASSED
✅ ESLint: PASSED (warnings only for ignored lexicon files)
✅ Build Process: SUCCESSFUL
```

### Test Coverage
- **Algorithm Tests**: Feed generation logic, error handling, parameter validation
- **Database Tests**: Database creation, migrations, CRUD operations, error scenarios
- **Custom Matchers**: AT-URI and DID validation utilities

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Express Server**: RESTful API with health endpoints and graceful shutdown
- **SQLite Database**: With Kysely query builder and migration system
